COBOL Create Test Data File 
This program will create a test line sequential file of 100,000 records.  It combines 4 separate input data files into one output data file. 
Included with this project are the input data files.  These files were derived from public open free data repositories.   
The data files are: 
1.	yobALL.txt which contains a list of first names. 
2.	last.all.txt which contains a list of last names.
3.	newdedup.address.csv contains a list of house numbers and street names.
4.	zip.city.state.csv contains a list of codes.
5.	Testdatafile01.out is the output file from the program.  The fields are Record: Count (which could be record-id), first name, last name, house number, street name, city, state, zip and a random yearly income pay amount. 
The data is from the United States public sources. 
Out put file is currently set for 100,000 records, which can be increased or decreased by editing the program. The data can be used for any purpose, like to build indexed files or database tables, or just for fun.
